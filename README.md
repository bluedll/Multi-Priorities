# Multi-Priorities
This script is a remake of Badgers Priority Script allowing you too make two or more priorities (one for LS and one for BC) depending on what AOP is via strings (YOU NEED BADSSENTIALS OR ANOTHER AOP SCRIPT FOR THIS TO WORK)

This requires an already installed Badger Priority Script and a seperate ACE Permission (add_ace group.admin Badger-Priorities2.Commands allow)
